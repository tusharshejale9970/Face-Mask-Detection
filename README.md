# Face-Mask-Detection
In this project two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results. Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

   1] Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
    2]Detect face masks in real-time video streams
